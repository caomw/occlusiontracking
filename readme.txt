Instructions:
1) Run the "ROT/run_tracker.m" script in MATLAB for single video tracking.
2) Choose one sequence (only "Girl" is included).

Other results on the whole benchmark:
All the results of 56 video sequences are put in "results/". 
We offer the results of three evaluation methods including "OPE", "SRE", and "TRE".
